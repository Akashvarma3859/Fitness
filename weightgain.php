            1.Don’t drink water before meals. This can fill your stomach and make it harder to get in enough calories. 
        </li>
        <li>
            2. Eat more often. Squeeze in an additional meal or snack whenever you can, such as before bed.
        </li>
        <li>
            3. Drink milk. Drinking whole milk to quench thirst is a simple way to get in more high-quality protein and calories.
        </li>
        <li>
            4. Try weight gainer shakes. If you’re really struggling then you can try weight gainer shakes. These are very high in protein, carbs and calories.
        </li>
        <li>
            5. Use bigger plates. Definitely use large plates if you’re trying to get in more calories, as smaller plates cause people to automatically eat less.
        </li>
        <li>
            6. Add cream to your coffee. This is a simple way to add in more calories.
        </li>
        <li>
            7.Take creatine. The muscle building supplement creatine monohydrate can help you gain a few pounds in muscle weight.

        </li>
        <li>
            8. Get quality sleep. Sleeping properly is very important for muscle growth.

        </li>
        <li>
            9. Eat your protein first and vegetables last. If you have a mix of foods on your plate, eat the calorie-dense and protein-rich foods first. Eat the vegetables last.
        </li>
        <li>
            10. Don’t smoke. Smokers tend to weigh less than non-smokers, and quitting smoking often leads to weight gain.
